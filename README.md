# How do I install this?
You probably should just just go [here](http://iabem97.github.io/saigon_website) and follow the instructions.

If you feel a bit more adventurous and want to see logs, use Xcode on a Mac (or a macOS VM), download the project and install XCode.

Open the project "blue icon" and hit run.

# Is this a full jailbreak?
Yes. Once you run it, Cydia will be installed.

Please note that it might fail multiple times at escaping sandbox or reboot during the process. If so, reboot (do not just close Saïgon and reopen it) and try again.

# Will you add support for my device?
If your device is "Not Supported" in the list above, then no. Saïgon will not be adding support to those devices.
If your device is supported but not yet on 10.3.1, please be patient and don't ask for ETA.

# I have an issue
Ask [on /r/jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/)

Do NOT report issues here, email, message, tweet me unless it's a unique bug that no one ever had. Othewise, I will not respond.
